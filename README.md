End-to-end analysis and interactive dashboard of self-reported co-op salary data using Python and modern data tools.

## Overview

This project provides a production-ready data application for analyzing co-op salary data. It includes modular code for data loading, analysis, and an interactive dashboard service to visualize insights.

## Usage

### Running the Dashboard

The dashboard application can be started using:

```bash
python dashboard/app.py
```

### Dashboard Frameworks

Streamlit was used to host this dashboard!


### Assumptions

1 month = 4 weeks

1 week = 40 hours

Co-op term = 16 weeks

USD → CAD conversion = fixed rate (e.g. 1.35)

For ranges, use the midpoint

For seniority increases, use the starting rate or average
